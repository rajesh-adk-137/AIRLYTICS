## 💡 About the Project

**AIRLYTICS** is an AI-native airline review intelligence platform that transforms 20,000+ unstructured passenger reviews into actionable business insights using **MindsDB Knowledge Bases** and **Agents**.

This isn't just another dashboard. It's a **conversational analytics engine** where business users ask questions in plain English and receive instant statistical breakdowns, beautiful visualizations, and AI-powered strategic recommendations.

### The Problem It Solves

Airlines collect thousands of customer reviews across multiple touchpoints, but extracting actionable intelligence from this unstructured feedback is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. Traditional BI tools fall short because:

- They can't understand natural language queries
- They require pre-defined metrics and rigid schemas
- They don't connect semantic context with statistical analysis
- They provide numbers without explaining *what to do about them*

**AIRLYTICS solves this** by combining:
- **Semantic + keyword search** for context-aware review retrieval
- **Metadata filtering** with structured fields (airlines, seat types, traveler categories, ratings)
- **Statistical engines** for deep analytical breakdowns
- **AI interpretation** that converts raw metrics into management-ready insights

### 🌐 Beyond Airlines: A Template for Experience Analytics

While AIRLYTICS focuses on airline reviews, **this architecture is a blueprint for any domain with unstructured feedback data**:

- **🏨 Hotel & Hospitality:** Guest reviews, service feedback, amenity ratings
- **🍽️ Food Services & Restaurants:** Delivery experiences, menu feedback, ambiance comments
- **🛒 E-commerce & Retail:** Product reviews, shopping experiences, return feedback
- **🏥 Healthcare:** Patient satisfaction, appointment experiences, facility reviews
- **📞 Customer Support:** Ticket descriptions, call transcripts, chat logs

With minor schema adjustments, this same semantic + SQL approach can power intelligent analytics for **any business collecting textual feedback**.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🧠 **Dual-Mode Intelligence**

#### **1. Semantic+Keyword Search Mode (Standard)** 
Find reviews using natural language descriptions — powered by MindsDB Knowledge Bases with vector embeddings.

**Perfect for:**
- *"excellent legroom and comfortable seats"*
- *"best crew and inflight service"*
- *"very long delay and bad food"*
- *"lost baggage, delayed luggage"*

**You Get:**
- Top 50 most relevant reviews with full metadata
- Summary statistics (avg rating, recommendation rate, verified users)
- Detailed rating breakdowns (seat comfort, staff, food, wifi, value)
- Distribution analysis (seat types, traveler types)
- Correlation matrices and field completeness
- Per-category averages (by airline, seat class, etc.)

---

#### **2. Advanced Analytics Mode (Agent-Powered)**
Ask complex analytical questions — the AI agent automatically interprets your intent, maps it to structured fields, and executes the appropriate statistical function.

**Perfect for:**
- *"For passengers complaining about check-in delays, show seat type distribution among those who rated ground service above 3."*
- *"Among reviews mentioning crowded flights, how many Economy Class passengers were Solo Leisure travelers compared to Business travelers?"*
- *"Users who complained about baggage claim delays — what percentage of those who rated ground service above 4 rated overall experience below 5?"*

**You Get Everything from Standard Mode PLUS:**
- Multi-dimensional statistical breakdowns
- Advanced visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, stacked comparisons)
- Targeted metrics based on your specific question
- Agent-interpreted semantic queries optimized for your analytical goal

---

### 📊 **Five Specialized Analytical Engines**

The agent automatically routes queries to the right function:

| Function | What It Solves |
|----------|----------------|
| `general_percentage_distribution` | Single-field percentage checks (e.g., "What % rated value above 4?") |
| `conditional_distribution_analysis` | Filtered category breakdowns (e.g., "Show seat types for delayed passengers") |
| `conditional_category_to_category_analysis` | Cross-category comparisons (e.g., "Economy vs Business traveler mix") |
| `conditional_rating_to_rating_analysis` | Numeric correlations with thresholds (e.g., "Low wifi + low satisfaction overlap") |
| `conditional_rating_analysis` | Rating-to-outcome analysis (e.g., "High food scores who also recommended") |

---

### 🎯 **Smart Sampling with Top-N Control**

AIRLYTICS doesn't analyze all 20,000+ reviews for every query — it focuses on **what matters most**.

**How it works:**
- Every query retrieves the **top N semantically matched reviews** based on MindsDB's similarity scoring
- Users control sample size via dropdown: **10, 20, 50, 75, or 100 rows** (100 = MindsDB Knowledge Base limit)
- All statistics, distributions, and correlations are computed from this focused, context-relevant subset

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Faster query execution
- ✅ Context-aware metrics (not diluted by unrelated reviews)
- ✅ Representative samples that directly answer your question
- ✅ Statistically grounded insights from real, matched data

---

### 🔍 **Rich Metadata Filtering**

AIRLYTICS supports multi-dimensional filtering across structured fields:

**Available Filters:**
- **Airlines:** British Airways, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, + others (unknowns auto-grouped as "Others")
- **Aircraft Types:** Boeing 777, Airbus A380, 787 Dreamliner, etc.
- **Seat Types:** Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First Class
- **Traveler Types:** Solo Leisure, Family Leisure, Couple Leisure, Business
- **Route Types:** Short-haul, Medium-haul, Long-haul
- **Verification Status:** Verified vs Trip Verified users
- **Date Ranges:** Filter by review publication dates
- **Recommendation Status:** Recommended vs Not Recommended
- **Rating Thresholds:** Any numeric field (overall_rating, seat_comfort, wifi_connectivity, food_beverages, etc.)

**Example Semantic + Metadata Query:**
```sql
SELECT content, airline, seat_type, overall_rating
FROM airline_reviews_kb
WHERE search_query = 'poor Wi-Fi and helpful staff'
  AND airline = 'Emirates'
  AND seat_type = 'Business Class'
  AND overall_rating >= 7
LIMIT 50;
```

---

### 💡 **AI InsightInterpreter**

Raw statistics tell you *what happened*. **InsightInterpreter tells you what to do about it.**

After any query (semantic or analytical), click **"Get AI Insights"** to activate your AI data strategist.

**What It Does:**
- ✅ Identifies hidden patterns and contradictions
- ✅ Explains root causes behind metrics
- ✅ Provides strategic + operational recommendations
- ✅ Writes in executive-friendly, decision-ready language

**Example Transformation:**

| ❌ Generic Output | ✅ InsightInterpreter Output |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| "Wi-Fi ratings average 2.8/5" | "Wi-Fi below 3 stars drops overall satisfaction by 68%. Upgrade routers on long-haul routes — it impacts loyalty more than catering." |
| "48% of users recommended the airline" | "High ratings but low recommendations suggest good service, weak loyalty. Review pricing strategy and frequent flyer perks." |
| "Business travelers rate cabin cleanliness 6.2/10" | "Business travelers forgive delays but hate dirty cabins. Prioritize cleaning staff over gate efficiency." |

**What It Doesn't Do:**
- ❌ Repeat your query or list basic stats
- ❌ Use filler phrases like "The data shows..."
- ❌ Give shallow or generic takeaways

**What It Does:**
- ✅ Uncover cause-effect relationships
- ✅ Speak like a data-driven strategist
- ✅ Deliver precise, actionable next steps

---

### 📈 **Comprehensive Base Statistics**

Every semantic query automatically generates **Base Stats** — a holistic view of matched reviews:

**Computed Metrics:**
- Numeric summaries (mean, median, std dev, min, max) for all rating fields
- Distribution analysis (skewness, outlier detection, histograms)
- Correlation matrix (relationships between rating dimensions)
- Categorical breakdowns (top airlines, seat types, traveler types, route patterns)
- Quality indicators (positive review %, recommendation rate, verified user %, field completeness)

**Visual Outputs:**
- Interactive heatmaps (correlation matrices)
- Distribution charts (histograms, box plots)
- Category bar charts with percentages
- Summary cards with key KPIs

## 📊 Example Use Cases & SQL Queries

### Semantic Search Queries
- *"excellent legroom and comfortable seats"*
- *"best crew and inflight service"*
- *"very long delay and bad food"*
- *"lost baggage, delayed luggage, mishandled bag"*
- *"value for money, affordable tickets"*

---

### Analytical Queries

#### 1. General Percentage Distribution
**Natural Language:** *"Out of all reviews mentioning slow boarding, what percentage of passengers rated value for money above 4?"*

```sql
SELECT answer
FROM analytics_query_agent 
WHERE question = 'Out of all reviews mentioning slow boarding, what percentage of passengers rated value for money above 4?';
```

**Use Case:** Fast threshold KPI to gauge price fairness perception after service issues.

---

#### 2. Conditional Distribution Analysis
**Natural Language:** *"For passengers complaining about check-in delays, show seat type distribution among those who rated ground service above 3."*

```sql
SELECT answer
FROM analytics_query_agent
WHERE question = 'For passengers complaining about check-in delays, show seat type distribution among those who rated ground service above 3.';
```

**Use Case:** Understand how service issues vary by cabin class when ground service remains decent.

---

#### 3. Conditional Category-to-Category Analysis
**Natural Language:** *"Among reviews mentioning crowded flights, how many Economy Class passengers were Solo Leisure travelers compared to Business travelers?"*

```sql
SELECT answer
FROM analytics_query_agent
WHERE question = 'Among reviews mentioning crowded flights, how many Economy Class passengers were Solo Leisure travelers compared to Business travelers?';
```

**Use Case:** Compare traveler demographics to target capacity management interventions.

---

#### 4. Conditional Rating-to-Rating Analysis
**Natural Language:** *"Users who complained about baggage claim delays — what percentage of those who rated ground service above 4 rated overall experience below 5?"*

```sql
SELECT answer
FROM analytics_query_agent
WHERE question = 'Users who complained about baggage claim delays — what percentage of those who rated ground service above 4 rated overall experience below 5?';
```

**Use Case:** Identify disconnects between strong individual touchpoints and weak overall satisfaction.

---

#### 5. Conditional Rating Analysis
**Natural Language:** *"Among users who mentioned poor inflight meals, what percent of those who rated food and beverages above 4 also recommended the airline?"*

```sql
SELECT answer
FROM analytics_query_agent
WHERE question = 'Among users who mentioned poor inflight meals, what percent of those who rated food and beverages above 4 also recommended the airline?';
```

**Use Case:** Check if high meal ratings align with recommendation intent despite negative meal mentions.

---

### Metadata Filtering Examples
- *"Emirates Business Class reviews mentioning delays, top 50 results"*
- *"Solo Leisure travelers on long-haul flights with Wi-Fi complaints, top 75"*
- *"Verified users rating overall experience above 8, top 100"*
